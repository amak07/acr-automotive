2. Find the newest import (highlighted in red)
3. Click the **Rollback** button on the right
4. Read the confirmation message carefully
   - It shows how many parts will be affected

5. Click **Confirm Rollback** if you're sure
6. Wait for the process to complete

**What you'll see**:
- A loading spinner while the rollback runs
- A success message when it's done
