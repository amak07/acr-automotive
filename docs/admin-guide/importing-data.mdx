> **For**: Admin staff | **Time**: ~10 minutes

## What This Does

The Import Wizard lets you make bulk changes to your catalog using Excel - adding many parts at once, updating vehicle applications for multiple parts, adding cross-references in bulk, and making mass corrections to part attributes.

**Important**: You must export your data first before importing. The system uses hidden ID columns in the export file to track which records to update.

---

## The Import Workflow

```
Export → Edit in Excel → Import → Review Changes → Confirm
```

1. **Export** your current data (see [Exporting Data](/docs/admin-guide/exporting-data))
2. **Edit** the Excel file with your changes
3. **Upload** the file using the Import Wizard
4. **Review** the validation results and change preview
5. **Confirm** to apply the changes

---

## Step 1: Export First

Before making bulk changes, always export your current data:

1. Go to `/admin`
2. Click **Export** in the header
3. Download the Excel file

This export contains hidden ID columns that the import process needs to track records. **Never delete or modify the hidden columns.**

---

## Step 2: Edit in Excel

Open the exported file in Excel. You'll see three sheets:

| Sheet | Contains |
|-------|----------|
| **Parts** | All ACR parts with attributes |
| **Vehicle Applications** | Which vehicles each part fits |
| **Cross References** | OEM and competitor part numbers |

### Making Changes

| To do this... | Do this in Excel |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Add a new part** | Add a row with ACR_SKU and details (leave _id blank) |
| **Update a part** | Find the row, change the values you need |
| **Delete a part** | Delete the entire row |
| **Add vehicle application** | Add a row with part's ACR_SKU in the link column |
| **Add cross-reference** | Add a row with part's ACR_SKU in the link column |

### Required Fields

**Parts sheet:**
- `ACR_SKU` - The part number (e.g., `ACR-12345`)
- `Part_Type` - Must be a valid type (Hub Assembly, Wheel Bearing, etc.)

**Vehicle Applications sheet:**
- `Start_Year` and `End_Year` - Year range
- `Make` and `Model` - Vehicle make/model

**Cross References sheet:**
- `Competitor_Brand` - The brand name
- `Competitor_SKU` - Their part number

---

## Step 3: Upload Your File

1. Go to `/admin/import`
2. Click **Upload** or drag your Excel file
3. Wait for validation to complete

**Supported formats:** `.xlsx` (Excel 2007+)
**Maximum file size:** 50 MB

---

## Step 4: Review Changes

After upload, you'll see a change preview:

### Validation Results

The system checks your file for errors and warnings.

**Errors (must fix before importing):**
- Missing required fields
- Invalid data formats
- Duplicate part numbers
- Orphaned records (vehicle apps or cross-refs without matching parts)

**Warnings (can proceed but please review):**
- Part type changed
- Year range narrowed
- Records being deleted

### Change Preview

You'll see a summary of what will happen:

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Add** | New records to be created |
| **Update** | Existing records that will change |
| **Delete** | Records to be removed |
| **Unchanged** | Records with no changes (won't be touched) |

Review the changes carefully before proceeding.

## Step 5: Confirm Import

If everything looks correct:

1. If there are warnings, check the "I acknowledge these warnings" box
2. Click **Import** to apply the changes
3. Wait for the import to complete

**What you'll see:**
- Progress indicator during import
- Success message with summary of changes
- Option to rollback if needed

---

## Rolling Back Changes

Made a mistake? You can undo the import:

1. After import completes, you'll see a **Rollback** button
2. Click it to restore your data to before the import
3. Confirm the rollback

The system keeps a snapshot of your data before each import, so you can always go back.

---

## Tips for Successful Imports

- **Always export first** - The hidden ID columns are essential
- **Make incremental changes** - Don't change everything at once
- **Review the preview carefully** - Check the counts match your expectations
- **Keep backup copies** - Save your Excel file before uploading
- **Use the rollback** - If something goes wrong, you can always undo
