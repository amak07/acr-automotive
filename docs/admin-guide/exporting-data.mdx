## What's in the Export File

The Excel file has three sheets:

### 1. Parts Sheet

Contains all your ACR parts with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ACR_SKU | The ACR part number |
| Part_Type | Hub Assembly, Wheel Bearing, etc. |
| Position_Type | Front, Rear, or Front/Rear |
| ABS_Type | With ABS, Without ABS |
| Drive_Type | FWD, RWD, AWD, 4WD |
| Bolt_Pattern | 4-bolt, 5-bolt, 6-bolt |
| Specifications | Technical notes |

### 2. Vehicle Applications Sheet

Shows which vehicles each part fits:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ACR_SKU | Links to the part |
| Start_Year | First year of fitment |
| End_Year | Last year of fitment |
| Make | Vehicle manufacturer |
| Model | Vehicle model |
| Submodel | Trim level or variant |

### 3. Cross References Sheet

Lists OEM and competitor part numbers:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ACR_SKU | Links to the part |
| Competitor_Brand | Brand name (Toyota, Timken, etc.) |
| Competitor_SKU | Their part number |
| Is_OEM | Whether this is the OEM number |

---

## Hidden ID Columns

Each sheet has hidden columns that store internal database IDs:
- `_id` - The record's unique ID
- `_part_id` - Links vehicle apps to parts
- `_acr_part_id` - Links cross-refs to parts

**Do not delete or modify these hidden columns.** They're essential for the import process to know which records to update.

To see hidden columns in Excel:
1. Right-click any column header
2. Select **Unhide**
3. The hidden columns will appear (Column A in each sheet)

## File Size and Performance

| Catalog Size | Export Time | File Size |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1,000 parts | ~2 seconds | ~500 KB |
| 10,000 parts | ~10 seconds | ~5 MB |
| 50,000 parts | ~30 seconds | ~25 MB |

Large exports may take longer. Don't navigate away while the export is generating.

## Using the Export for Bulk Changes

1. **Export** your current data
2. **Open** the Excel file
3. **Make your changes** (add rows, edit values, delete rows)
4. **Save** the file
5. **Import** the modified file (see [Importing Data](/docs/admin-guide/importing-data))

This workflow lets you use Excel's powerful features (filters, find/replace, formulas) to make bulk changes efficiently.

## Tips

- **Export before importing** - Always work from a fresh export
- **Keep the original** - Save a backup copy before making changes
- **Don't rename sheets** - The import process expects exact sheet names
- **Don't move columns** - Column order matters for the import
