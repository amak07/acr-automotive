## What This Does

This feature lets you add two types of images to parts: product photos (standard images showing the part) and 360° viewer (multiple frames creating an interactive spinning view).

**Which upload method should I use?**

| Situation | Method | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Adding images to **one part** | Single-part upload | Visual preview, drag-to-reorder, no filename requirements |
| Adding images to **many parts** | Bulk upload | Automatic SKU matching from filenames |

---

## Adding Images to a Single Part

Use this when you're editing a specific part and want to add or manage its images.

1. Go to `/admin` and find the part
2. Click on the part to open its detail page
3. Scroll to the **Images** section

### Product Photos

**To upload:**
1. Click **Upload Images** button
2. Select one or more image files
3. Images appear in the gallery

**Managing photos:**
- **Reorder**: Drag and drop images to change display order
- **Set primary**: The first image becomes the primary (shown in search results)
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon on any image

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max images per part | 10 |
| Max file size | 5 MB |
| Formats | JPG, PNG, WebP |

### 360° Viewer

The 360° viewer creates an interactive spinning view from multiple photos taken at different angles.

**To upload:**
1. Click **Upload 360° Frames** button
2. Select all frame images at once
3. Preview grid appears showing frames in order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
4. **Verify the order** - frames play in this sequence during rotation
5. Drag frames to reorder if needed, or uncheck frames to exclude them
6. Click **Confirm Upload** when the sequence looks correct

**Frame ordering:**
- Files initially appear in alphabetical order by filename
- **Tip**: Name files sequentially (e.g., `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`... or `frame_001.jpg`, `frame_002.jpg`) so they sort correctly
- Use drag-and-drop to fix any out-of-order frames before uploading

**Managing the viewer:**
- **Replace**: Upload new frames to replace the existing viewer
- **Delete**: Remove the entire 360° viewer (all-or-nothing)

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Minimum frames | 12 |
| Recommended frames | 24 |
| Maximum frames | 48 |
| Max file size | 10 MB per frame |
| Formats | JPG, PNG, WebP |

## Bulk Image Upload

Use this when you have images for many parts and filenames contain SKU numbers. The system automatically matches images to parts based on filenames.

### Accessing Bulk Upload

1. Go to `/admin/bulk-image-upload`
2. You'll see a list of all parts with their image status

### Filtering Parts

Use the filters to find parts that need images:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Search** | Find by SKU or description |
| **Has Images** | All, Has Images, No Images |
| **Has 360°** | All, Has 360°, No 360° |

### Uploading Product Images in Bulk

1. Click **Upload Product Images** button
2. Select multiple image files
3. The system automatically extracts SKU numbers from filenames and matches to parts

**How matching works:**

The system extracts numeric SKU portions from filenames using multiple strategies:

| Filename | Extracted SKU | Matches Part |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| `CTK512016_fro.jpg` | `512016` | `ACR512016` |
| `512016_front.jpg` | `512016` | `ACR512016` |
| `ACR512016.jpg` | `512016` | `ACR512016` |
| `BRAND123456_view.jpg` | `123456` | `ACR123456` |

- The system looks for 5-8 digit numbers in filenames
- Letter prefixes (like `CTK`, `ACR`, `BRAND`) are automatically stripped
- Fuzzy matching finds the closest part (85% similarity threshold)
- Multiple images per part are supported

### Uploading 360° Images in Bulk

Upload 360° frame sets for many parts at once. The system automatically detects multiple 360° viewer sets from a single folder of images.

1. Click **Upload 360° Images** button
2. Select all frame images (can include frames for multiple parts)
3. Review the detected parts and frame counts
4. Click **Upload** to process all valid sets

**How detection works:**

The system groups images by SKU and frame number from filenames:

| Filename | Extracted SKU | Frame # |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `ACR2302007_1.jpg` | `ACR2302007` | 1 |
| `ACR2302007_24.jpg` | `ACR2302007` | 24 |
| `CTK512016_12.jpg` | `CTK512016` | 12 |

**Requirements for each 360° set:**
- Minimum **12 frames** per part
- SKU must exist in the database
- Filename must end with `_N.jpg` where N is the frame number (1-99)

**Example:** Upload a folder containing:
```
ACR2302007_1.jpg through ACR2302007_24.jpg  → 24 frames for ACR2302007
ACR2302008_1.jpg through ACR2302008_24.jpg  → 24 frames for ACR2302008
CTK512016_1.jpg through CTK512016_36.jpg    → 36 frames for CTK512016
```

The system will detect 3 separate 360° viewers and upload them to the matching parts.

## Viewing Image Status

On the Bulk Upload page, each part shows:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Image count** | Number of product photos |
| **360° badge** | Has 360° viewer (green checkmark) |
| **No images** | Needs images (red indicator) |

---

## Tips for Good Images

- **Use consistent lighting** - Avoid shadows and reflections
- **Center the part** - Leave some margin around edges
- **Show key details** - Include angles that show fitment points
- **Use white background** - Makes the part stand out
- **High resolution** - At least 800×800 pixels
