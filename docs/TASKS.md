**Next Session Priorities**:

- Consider implementing image upload functionality for new parts
- Review any remaining UX improvements for the create interface

**Current State**: Add New Part interface fully functional, modal form state bugs resolved, admin interface feature-complete

## üöÄ Active Development Areas

### High Priority
- [ ] **Image Management System**: Complete part image upload/management functionality via Supabase Storage
- ‚úÖ **Add New Part Interface**: Complete "Create New Part" functionality in admin interface
- [ ] **Enhancement Planning**: Review and prioritize features from ENHANCEMENTS.md roadmap

### Awaiting Stakeholder Input
- [ ] **Spanish Translation**: Complete production translation using existing i18n system (requires Humberto's review for translation requirements)

### Admin Interface Completion
- [ ] **Image Upload/Management**: Admin interface for part images (upload, replace, delete)
- ‚úÖ **New Part Creation**: Full workflow for adding new parts with all required fields
- [ ] **Dynamic Field Values**: Allow adding new values for Position, ABS Type, Drive Type, Bolt Pattern (not just existing database values)

3. **Include specific file changes** and technical decisions made
4. **Note next priorities** based on what was discussed
5. **Update the "Latest Session" section** with the new summary
6. **Update the current date** in the header

This keeps the file focused on current work rather than historical task completion details.
