## üîÑ Current Session State

> **Session Update Instructions for Claude**: When asked to update session state, use this template:

### Session Summary Template
```markdown
**Date**: [Current Date]
**Focus**: [Main areas worked on]
**Completed**:
- [Concise list of what was accomplished]
- [Include file changes, features implemented, issues resolved]

**Key Changes**:
- [Important technical changes or decisions made]
- [Files modified or created]
- [Architecture updates]

**Next Session Priorities**:
- [What should be tackled next]
- [Any blockers or decisions needed]

**Current State**: [Brief project status after this session]
```

### Latest Session: September 23, 2025
**Focus**: Documentation organization and enhancement roadmap preparation
**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Moved all documentation files to `docs/` folder for better organization
- ‚úÖ Completely reorganized PLANNING.md - reduced from 738 to ~314 lines, focused on technical architecture
- ‚úÖ Completely reorganized ENHANCEMENTS.md - reduced from 290 to 144 lines, prioritized by implementation phases
- ‚úÖ Updated README.md with current production status and latest dependency versions
- ‚úÖ Streamlined CLAUDE.md from 217 to 69 lines - now serves as proper context initialization file
- ‚úÖ Enhanced ENHANCEMENTS.md with business value explanations for Humberto's review

**Key Changes**:
- Documentation structure now follows clear separation: technical architecture (PLANNING.md), future improvements (ENHANCEMENTS.md), project overview (README.md)
- CLAUDE.md now points to documentation locations rather than duplicating content
- Removed outdated information (Zustand usage, business requirements from technical docs)
- ENHANCEMENTS.md ready for stakeholder presentation with clear business value explanations

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Present ENHANCEMENTS.md to stakeholder for feature prioritization
- Begin Spanish translation implementation based on current i18n system
- Consider any additional documentation needs for handoff

**Current State**: Documentation fully organized, production system stable, ready for future enhancement planning

## üöÄ Active Development Areas

### High Priority
- [ ] **Spanish Translation**: Complete production translation using existing i18n system
- [ ] **Image Management System**: Complete part image upload/management functionality via Supabase Storage
- [ ] **Add New Part Interface**: Ensure complete "Create New Part" functionality in admin interface
- [ ] **Enhancement Planning**: Review and prioritize features from ENHANCEMENTS.md roadmap

### Admin Interface Completion
- [ ] **Image Upload/Management**: Admin interface for part images (upload, replace, delete)
- [ ] **New Part Creation**: Full workflow for adding new parts with all required fields
- [ ] **Dynamic Field Values**: Allow adding new values for Position, ABS Type, Drive Type, Bolt Pattern (not just existing database values)
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Multi-part selection and batch operations (from ENHANCEMENTS.md Phase 3)

### UX Improvements Needed
- [ ] **Flexible Field Input**: Convert rigid dropdowns to combo boxes that allow new value entry
- [ ] **Field Value Management**: Admin interface to manage allowed values for dropdown fields
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Ensure new field values follow proper formatting and business rules

### Future Enhancements
See `docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md` for complete prioritized roadmap of potential improvements.

## üìã Technical Maintenance

### Infrastructure Tasks (Future)
- [ ] **Development Branch Setup**: Create dev branch for testing environment
- [ ] **Production URL Configuration**: Update environment variables for production domain
- [ ] **Enhanced Authentication**: Upgrade from MVP password to professional auth system
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Implement application monitoring and alerting

## üìù Session Update Instructions

**For Claude**: When the user asks to "update session state" or "log current session":

1. **Use the Session Summary Template above**
2. **Be concise** - focus on what was actually accomplished
3. **Include specific file changes** and technical decisions made
4. **Note next priorities** based on what was discussed
5. **Update the "Latest Session" section** with the new summary
6. **Update the current date** in the header

This keeps the file focused on current work rather than historical task completion details.
