## üîç Task Management Guidelines

### Task Status Definitions

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Task finished and tested
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- ‚è≥ **NOT STARTED** - In backlog, not yet begun
- üö´ **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- üìã **NEEDS REVIEW** - Complete but needs validation

### Task Dependencies

- **Database tasks** must complete before search implementation
- **Excel parser** required before admin upload interface
- **i18n setup** should be done early to avoid refactoring
- **Mock auth** enables admin feature development
- **Search functionality** required before production deployment

### Definition of Done (MVP)

Each task is considered complete when:

- [ ] Functionality works as specified
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Component is mobile-responsive
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Basic testing is complete (core features only)
- [ ] Translation keys are added for all UI text
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed

### Testing Requirements (Simplified)

- **Core features only**: Excel parsing, search functionality, data validation
- **Type-safe factories**: Ensure schema changes break tests appropriately
- **Critical paths**: Authentication (when added), cross-reference accuracy
- **Performance**: Search response times under 300ms

## üìù Development Notes

### Code Standards

- **File size limit**: 500 lines maximum per file
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, avoid `any` types
- **Testing**: Focus on critical business logic
- **Documentation**: Update PLANNING.md when architecture changes

### Key Decisions Made

- ‚úÖ **Database**: 3 tables only (parts, vehicle_applications, cross_references)
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Mock for MVP, real auth post-MVP
- ‚úÖ **i18n**: Custom simple solution, not next-i18next
- ‚úÖ **Images**: Admin upload interface, no Google Drive migration
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Block Excel imports on any validation errors
- ‚úÖ **Tech Stack**: Replaced Prisma+NextAuth with Supabase+TanStack Query
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Added xlsx, zustand, @supabase/supabase-js, @tanstack/react-query

### Recently Discovered Tasks

- **TASK-004A**: Create Zustand store for search state management
- **TASK-007A**: Add Excel file type validation (XLSX, XLS only)
- **TASK-010A**: Add number/date formatting utilities for Mexican locale
